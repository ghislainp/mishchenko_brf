The original and most important of this software is the refl.f program authored by M. Mishchenko, NASA
The full license is in the file refl.f. In a nutshell, it is stipulated that:

C   The code can be used without limitations in any not-for-       
C   profit scientific research.  The only request is that in any       
C   publication using the code the source of the code be acknowledged  
C   and relevant references be made.           

C   WHILE THE COMPUTER PROGRAM HAS BEEN TESTED FOR A VARIETY OF CASES,
C   IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT IT CONTAINS UNDETECTED ERRORS. ALSO,
C   INPUT PARAMETERS CAN BE USED WHICH ARE OUTSIDE THE ENVELOPE OF
C   VALUES FOR WHICH RESULTS ARE COMPUTED ACCURATELY. FOR THIS REASON,
C   THE AUTHORS AND THEIR ORGANIZATION DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR
C   ANY DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE PROGRAM. 


The code added to provide the python binding, build system and test suite around refl.f is MIT Licensed.
